#Rc4

This workspace contains two projects that perform Rc4 encryption and decryption. One project is written in Objective-C, the other, Swift. Which language is fastest?

The code is written in a manner that someone would write regularly. I intentionally left the new functional hotness out. I didn't want it to distract from the goal. This code is also not as optimised as it could be. And there are no compiler 'ooh fast' switch optimisations. 

##To Run The Tests

Open the workspace. Run the unit tests for each project and compare the performance results.
